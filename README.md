# Slideshow
This is a JavaScript file for a slideshow controller. It allows for easy navigation between slides and dots.

# Usage
The slideshow function takes a slide number as a parameter and displays that slide while hiding all other slides. It also sets the background color of the corresponding dot to black.

The controller function takes a parameter x which represents the number of slides to move forwards or backwards. It then calls the slideshow function with the new slide index.

The dots_controller function takes a dot index as a parameter and calls the slideshow function with the corresponding slide index.
