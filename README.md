# Slideshow
This slideshow is a simple and customizable way to display images with navigation buttons. The slideshow is made up of four image slides with a corresponding slide number and navigation buttons at the bottom.

# Getting Started
To use this slideshow, follow these steps:

Download the files **index.html**, **style.css**, and **script.js**.
Place these files in the same directory.
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the slideshow.
# Usage
The **slideshow** function takes a slide number as a parameter and displays that slide while hiding all other slides. It also sets the background color of the corresponding dot to black.

The **controller** function takes a parameter x which represents the number of slides to move forwards or backwards. It then calls the slideshow function with the new slide index.

The **dots_controller** function takes a dot index as a parameter and calls the slideshow function with the corresponding slide index.
