# Slideshow
This slideshow is a simple and customizable way to display images with navigation buttons. The slideshow is made up of four image slides with a corresponding slide number and navigation buttons at the bottom.

# Getting Started
To use this slideshow, follow these steps:

Download the files **index.html**, **style.css**, and **script.js**.
Place these files in the same directory.
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the slideshow.
# How it Works
The **slideshow** function takes a slide number as a parameter and displays that slide while hiding all other slides. It also sets the background color of the corresponding dot to black.
The slideshow is controlled by two functions in the **script.js** file. The **controller** function moves the slideshow forward or backward by updating the slide_index variable and calling the slideshow function. The **dots_controller** function allows users to jump to a specific slide by updating the slide_index variable and calling the slideshow function.
